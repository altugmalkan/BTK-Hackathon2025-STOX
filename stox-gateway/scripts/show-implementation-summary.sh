echo "🔧 Core Features:"
echo "   ✅ Secure S3 bucket with private access"
echo "   ✅ CloudFront CDN for global image delivery"
echo "   ✅ User-specific folder structure (users/{user_id}/original|enhanced)"
echo "   ✅ JWT-based authentication and authorization"
echo "   ✅ Automatic image enhancement workflow"
echo "   ✅ Presigned URLs for secure access"
echo "   ✅ Server-side encryption (AES256)"
echo "   ✅ Origin Access Control (OAC) for security"
echo ""

echo "🛡️  Security Best Practices:"
echo "   ✅ Private S3 bucket (no public access)"
echo "   ✅ User isolation (users can only access their own images)"
echo "   ✅ IAM policies with least privilege"
echo "   ✅ CloudFront with HTTPS-only access"
echo "   ✅ Comprehensive input validation"
echo "   ✅ JWT token validation for all operations"
echo ""

echo "📊 Business Logic Flow:"
echo "   1. 👤 User uploads image via frontend"
echo "   2. 🔒 Gateway validates JWT token"
echo "   3. 📤 Gateway uploads original image to S3 (users/{id}/original/)"
echo "   4. ✅ Gateway responds with upload success + CloudFront URL"
echo "   5. 🔄 Gateway sends S3 URL to image service for enhancement"
echo "   6. 🤖 Image service downloads, processes, and uploads enhanced image"
echo "   7. 📥 Enhanced image stored in S3 (users/{id}/enhanced/)"
echo "   8. 🌐 All images delivered via CloudFront CDN"
echo ""

echo "🌐 API Endpoints:"
echo "   POST /api/v1/images/upload    # Upload and process images"
echo "   GET  /api/v1/images/list      # List user's images"
echo "   DELETE /api/v1/images/delete  # Delete user's images"
echo ""

echo "⚙️  Next Steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🏗️  Setup AWS Infrastructure:"
echo "   ./scripts/setup-aws-infrastructure.sh"
echo "   OR"
echo "   cd terraform && terraform apply"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔧 Configure Environment:"
echo "   cp .env.example .env"
echo "   # Edit .env with your AWS credentials"
echo ""
echo "3. 🚀 Run the Application:"
echo "   docker-compose up -d"
echo "   OR"
echo "   go run cmd/api-gateway/main.go"
echo ""
echo "4. 📖 Read the Documentation:"
echo "   cat AWS_INTEGRATION.md"
echo ""

echo "💡 Key Benefits Achieved:"
echo "   🔒 Enterprise-grade security with AWS best practices"
echo "   🌍 Global image delivery through CloudFront CDN"
echo "   💰 Cost-optimized with S3 lifecycle policies"
echo "   📈 Scalable architecture for millions of images"
echo "   🔍 Complete audit trail and monitoring"
echo "   🚀 Production-ready infrastructure"

echo "🏆 Architecture Highlights:"
echo "   • Zero public access to S3 - complete privacy"
echo "   • CloudFront Origin Access Control for S3 security"
echo "   • JWT authentication for all image operations"
echo "   • User-based folder isolation for multi-tenancy"
echo "   • Automatic image enhancement pipeline"
echo "   • Global CDN for optimal performance"
echo "   • Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"
echo "   • Comprehensive error handling and logging"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Production Ready:"
echo "   ✅ Security: WAF, encryption, private access"
echo "   ✅ Performance: CDN, compression, caching"
echo "   ✅ Reliability: Retry logic, health checks"
echo "   ✅ Monitoring: Structured logging, metrics"
echo "   ✅ Cost optimization: Lifecycle policies"
echo "   ✅ Compliance: Audit trails, access controls"
